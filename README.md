This is my first attempt at recreating dog party. This project incorporates HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Phase One: Basic Requirements

The first phase of this project required attempting to visually recreate the static dog party page as accurately as possible using HTML and CSS. In this phase, multiple HTML elements were incorprated such as lists, paragraphs, and headers. CSS aspects such as classes, backgrounds, and the box model were used as well.

Phase Two: More Better

In the second phase, Javascript was added in order to make the page responsive. If you type in the name of your dog, the text of the "header "A Site About Some Dogs" will be replaced by "A Site about" and then the name you entered.

CSS was also updated so that as the width of the page becomes smaller, the navigation bar will increase in height and the navigation links will be display in vertical blocks in order to make the page more accessible for mobile users.
